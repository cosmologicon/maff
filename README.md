# maff
Python convenience functions that I wish were in the math module, as well as some that I agree
probably shouldn't be.

## Quick usage

	import maff
	print(maff.ease(0.1))

The first time you import `maff`, it will also pollute the `math` module with its own functions, so
you can call them via `math` on any module that imports `math`.

	import maff, math
	print(math.ease(0.1))

## To install

Download `maff.py` and put it in your source directory. To install from command line:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmologicon/maff/master/maff.py > my-source-directory/maff.py

## Usage notes

As the name hopefully implies, this is a bit of a frivolous module and not recommended for serious
use. I plan to use it for game jams.

Any function that accepts a "vector" expects some iterable, typically a list, tuple, `pygame.math.Vector2`,
etc. Try your vector type and see if it works. If not, file an issue, and I should be able to support it.

## Constants

`maff.tau`: the circle constant equal to 2pi.

`maff.phi` and `maff.Phi`: golden ratio and reciprocal golden ratio.

`maff.phyllo`: so-called "golden" divergence angle of phyllotaxis, equal to `tau * (2 - phi)`,
equivalent to about 137.5Â°.

## Functions taken from GLSL

`maff.sign(x)`: sign of x.

`maff.clamp(x, a, b)`: clamps x to range [a, b].

`maff.mix(x, y, a)`: mix the values x and y with mixing factor a. The value of a is clamped to the
range [0, 1]. Also works for vector-valued x and y.

`maff.imix(x, y, a)`: like `mix`, but converts the value to the nearest integer.

`maff.step(edge, x)`: Heaviside step function of x with given edge.

`maff.smoothstep(edge0, edge1, x)`: step function with Hermite interpolation between edge0 and
edge1.

`maff.length(v)`: length of vector v. Can be any iterable.

`maff.distance(v0, v1)`: distance between vectors v0 and v1

`maff.dot(v0, v1)`: dot product

`maff.norm(v)` or `maff.normalize(v)`: normalize vector to length 1. Does not fail on zero vector.

`maff.norm(v, a)` or `maff.normalize(v, a)`: normalize vector to length a.

## Fade functions

`maff.ease(x)`: Hermite interpolation of x in range (0, 1). Equal to `maff.smoothstep(0, 1, x)`.

`maff.fade(x, x0, dx)`: fade from 0 to 1 starting at x = x0 for a fade interval of dx.

`maff.smoothfade(x, x0, dx)`: like `fade` with Hermite interpolation.

`maff.dfade(x, x0, x1, dx)`: double-fade from 0 to 1 starting at x0, then back from 1 to 0 ending at
x1, with a fade interval of dx on both ends.

`maff.dsmoothfade(x, x0, x1, dx)`: double-fade with Hermite interpolation.

`maff.fadebetween(x, x0, y0, x1, y1)` or `maff.interp(x, x0, y0, x1, y1)`: returns the y-value such
that (x, y) is linearly interpolated between the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). Works for
vector-valued y's.

`maff.smoothfadebetween(x, x0, y0, x1, y1)` or `maff.smoothinterp(x, x0, y0, x1, y1)`: returns the
y-value such that (x, y) is smoothly interpolated between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). Works for
vector-valued y's.

`maff.cycle(a)`: sinusoidal cycle between 0 and 1 and back to 0 with period 1. Can be used with
`maff.mix` to cycle between two values: `maff.mix(x, y, maff.cycle(a))`.

## Approach functions

`maff.approach(x, target, dx)`: increase or decrease x by amount dx in the direction of target. If
the distance between x and target is less than dx, then return target instead. x and target can be
vectors.

`maff.softapproach(x, target, dlogx)`: increase or decrease x by an amount determined by dlogx.
dlogx is a unitless parameter between 0 and infinity. If dlogx is 0, then x will be returned. For
sufficiently large dlogx, then target will be returned. Calling this repeatedly and updating the
value of x will give exponential decay toward target, with a timescale factor of 1 / dlogx.

`maff.softapproach(x, target, dlogx, dxmax=inf, dymin=0.1)`: After calculating the approach
distance dx, it's compared with dxmax. If it exceeds dxmax then it's capped at dxmax. If the
result is a distance less than dymin away from target, then target is returned. This is because with
exponential decay it's impossible to ever exactly reach target.

## Angular analogues

The "A" in the function and variable names indicates angles in radians. Different angles are
treated equivalent if they are equal modulo tau.

`maff.dA(A)`: returns the angle equivalent to A (mod tau) that's closest to 0.

`maff.mixA(A0, A1, a)`: returns a value equal to A0 at a = 0, and A1 at a = 1. In between it takes
the shortest path around the circle.

`maff.fadebetweenA(x, x0, A0, x1, A1)` or `maff.interpA(x, x0, A0, x1, A1)`: linear angular
interpolation. Note that only A0 and A1 are treated as angles, not x, x0, and x1.

`maff.smoothfadebetweenA(x, x0, A0, x1, A1)` or `maff.smoothinterpA(x, x0, A0, x1, A1)`: smooth
angular interpolation. Note that only A0 and A1 are treated as angles, not x, x0, and x1.

`maff.approachA(A, targetA, deltaA)`: increase or decrease A in the direction of targetA by the
amount deltaA, taking the shortest path around the circle.

`maff.softapproachA(A, targetA, dlogA)`: exponential angular approach function.

## Log-space analogues

Simple convenience functions for doing interpolation in log space. The function simply takes the
logarithm of any argument with "L", and then takes the exponential of the result before returning.
For example, `maff.mixL(xL, yL, 0.5)` returns the geometric mean of xL and yL rather than the
arithmetic mean.

`maff.mixL(xL, yL, a)`

`maff.fadebetweenL(x, x0, yL0, x1, yL1)` or `maff.interpL(x, x0, yL0, x1, yL1)`

`maff.smoothfadebetweenL(x, x0, yL0, x1, yL1)` or `maff.smoothinterpL(x, x0, yL0, x1, yL1)`

`maff.approachL(xL, targetL, dx)`

`maff.softapproachL(xL, targetL, dlogx)`

## Trigonometry and Rotation

`maff.CS(theta)`: 2-tuple of cos(theta), sin(theta).

`maff.CS(theta, r)`: 2-tuple of r cos(theta), r sin(theta).

`maff.CSround(ntheta)`: Produces ntheta 2-tuples of cos(theta), sin(theta) distributed around the
unit circle.

`maff.CSround(ntheta, r=1, jtheta0=0)`: specify radius and offset.

`maff.R(theta, (x, y))`: 2-tuple of the vector <x, y> rotated counterclockwise by the angle `theta`.

`maff.R(theta)`: returns a function that takes a single vector argument, and return that vector
rotated counterclockwise by the angle `theta`.

## Pseudorandom values

`maff.fuzz(*args)`: produce a number in the range [0, 1) that is deterministically calculated from
any number of numerical arguments. The result can be treated as a low-quality pseudorandom number,
using the arguments as a seed. Differences in the arguments smaller than 1e-6 may result in
correlations. That is, `maff.fuzz(x)` may be close or equal to `maff.fuzz(x + 1e-7)`.

`maff.fuzzrange(a, b, *args)`: produce a number in the range [a, b). Equivalent to:
`maff.mix(a, b, maff.fuzz(*args))`.
